Compiler-Construction
=====================

Worked on the creation of control flow graphs and conducted the dominator analysis to identify loops in the cfg.

Worked on Basic Block profiling, Edge Profiling and Loop Iterations count. 

Languages used: C and Intermediate representation(IR) language

Here is the first part of the project. To compile type
make

That will generate an executable file named Driver

To run type ./Driver <file> where <file> is your input file.
Main input file used is input.txt.
Also tested on the test1 input file test1.mil
Also tested on the test2 input file test2.mil
Also tested on the test3 input file test3.mil
Also tested on the test4 input file test4.mil

In all the 4 testcases and sample input file I'm getting the expected out.

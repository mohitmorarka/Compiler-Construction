Here is the first part of the project. To compile type
make

That will generate an executable file named Driver

To run type ./Driver <file> where <file> is your input file.
Main input file used is input.txt.
Also tested on the test1 input file test1.mil
Also tested on the test2 input file test2.mil
Also tested on the test3 input file test3.mil
Also tested on the test4 input file test4.mil

In all the 4 testcases and sample input file I'm getting the expected out.
